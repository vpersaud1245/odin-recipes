    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is
        the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8
            minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and
            simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the
            meat sauce, remaining ziti, mozzrella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
