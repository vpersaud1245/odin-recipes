    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This copycat Cheddar&apos;s Key West chicken and shrimp dish, with a delicious homemade pineapple pico de gallo,
        is
        packed with flavor and color. Chicken and shrimp are marinated briefly in a zingy jalapeño-lime marinade,
        grilled, and then topped with pineapple pico de gallo. Served with rice or cauliflower rice, and a green
        vegetable or tossed salad, this makes a stunning meal.</p>

        <li>4 boneless skinless chiken breasts</li>
        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>lime wedges (optional)</li>
        <li>fresh cilantro sprigs (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pineapple, red onion, 1/4 cup minced jalapeño, tomato, 3 tablespoons cilantro, 2 tablespoons lime
            juice, and 1 pinch salt in a non-reactive bowl, and toss to mix well. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>In a bowl with a cover, stir together orange juice, 1/2 cup minced jalapeño, white wine vinegar, zest and
            juice of 1 lime, avocado oil, honey, soy sauce, granulated garlic, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pound chicken to a uniform thickness and place in an 11x7-inch baking dish. Pour half the marinade over
            chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour, turning about halfway through.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade until ready to use.</li>
        <li>After chicken has marinated 45 minutes, place shrimp into the bowl with remaining marinade, and toss to coat
            shrimp well. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove shrimp from marinade but do not dry. Place shrimp on metal skewers and refrigerate until ready to
            use. Discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Clean and oil the grates, using tongs and an oil-saturated paper
            towel.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade, but do not dry. Discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side, depending on
            thickness. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of chicken, should read at least 165
            degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a plate and keep warm under a foil tent.</li>
        <li>Grill shrimp skewers until shrimp is opaque and has some color from the grill, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve each chicken breast with pineapple pico de gallo. Top with grilled shrimp; garnish with lime slices and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
